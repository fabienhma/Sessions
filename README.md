Sessions - the Android App

This is the source code for a productivity app I'm working on, Sessions!

The premise of the app is this: you can create "sessions" with set session lengths, break lengths, and notification types for different activities, and upon unlocking your phone, the app will warn you when you've reached your pre-assigned "break" length (either through a Toast, a notification, or by straight up turning your phone screen off.

Still a work in progress though – I'm not sure about turning the phone screen off without getting some kind of system-level permission.
